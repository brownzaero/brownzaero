### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zach

I'm a systems analyst expanding my software development skills.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Automation & Efficiency Initiative at Beacon Health System where I'm developing VBA macro automations, Unix shell scripts, Windows batch scripts, and SQL reports to improve processes and efficiency for the Finance department.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front End Development Libraries through freeCodeCamp. 
* I recently earned their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/brownzaero/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">**Responsive Web Design**</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/brownzaero/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures" target="_blank">**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**</a> certifications where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
